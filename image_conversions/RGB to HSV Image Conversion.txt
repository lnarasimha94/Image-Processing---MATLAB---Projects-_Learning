***** Converting RGB image to HSV image - rgb2hsv() *****

RGB color space consists of 3 channels each of R, G & B color whereas HSV color space consists of 3 channels respectively Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Value (V) channels. RGB image is used for viewing whereas HSV image color space is preferred for image processing.

First let us read an RGB image.
A = imread('filename.extension');

Individual R, G & B channels can be extracted as:
R = A(:, :, 1);
G = A(:, :, 2);
B = A(:, :, 3);

Now let us convert this RGB image to HSV color space as:
A_hsv = rgb2hsv(A);

Now individual H, S & V channels can be extracted as same as the RGB image channels as:
H = A_hsv(:, :, 1);
S = A_hsv(:, :, 2);
V = A_hsv(:, :, 3);

Displaying the RGB and HSV images and individual channels.


The V channel looks alike the grayscale conversion image of RGB image. V channels displays the intensity image corresponding to the RGB image.
