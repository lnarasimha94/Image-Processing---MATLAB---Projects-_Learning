***** Converting RGB image to Grayscale - rgb2gray() *****

First let us read an rgb image.
A = imread('filename.extension');

RGB image contains 3 channels which can be verified as:
number_of_channels = size(A, 3);

Now let say if we want to convert this RGB image to Grayscale, we will rename the grayscale image as "A_gray".
A_gray = rgb2gray(A);

Now display the original and converted image side-by-side for comparison.
figure, subplot(1, 2, 1), imshow(A), title('Input RGB image');
subplot(1, 2, 2), imshow(A_gray), title('Converted Grayscale image');
