***** Image De-noising *****

In this lecture, we will compare the effect of Gaussian filter vs. Average filter vs. Median filter for Salt & Pepper noise reduction. Let us start with reading an input image as:
A = imread('filename.extension');

Generate Gaussian and Average filter for filtering image as:
h_gaussian = fspecial('gaussian');
h_average = fspecial('average');

Filter the input image using Gaussian and Average filter as:
B_gaussian = imfilter(A, h_gaussian);
B_average = imfilter(A, h_average);

Filter the input image using Median filter as:
B_median = medfilt2(A);

Display original and filtered images side-by-side for comparing the result of image de-noising. As visible from the displayed images, Median filtering performs best for de-noising images contaminated with Salt & Pepper noise.
