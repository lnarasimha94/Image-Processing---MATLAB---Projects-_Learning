***** Project: Count the number of faces in an image *****

The aim of this project will be to count the number of faces in a given image. This project aims to use the face detector functionality provided with MATLAB.

Let us begin by reading an input image:
A = imread('filename.extension');

Now we will initialize a cascade face detector object using the following code:
faceDetector = vision.CascadeObjectDetector();

We will perform face detection to get bounding boxes of individual faces as:
bbox = step(faceDetector, A);

Finally we would like to display each face's bounding box superimposed on the original image which can be implemented as:
B = insertObjectAnnotation(A, 'rectangle', bbox, 'Face');
figure, imshow(B), title('Detected face');

And now we print the number of detected faces to the MATLAB console window using:
str = num2str(size(bbox, 1));
str = strcat('Number of detected faces = ', str);
disp(str);

Number of detected faces in the image is displayed in MATLAB console.
